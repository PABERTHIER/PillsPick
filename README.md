# PillsPick

This project needs Node.js and Yarn (install Yarn with npm).
Open the terminal in the */front* root and run `yarn` to install all dependencies.
Once done, run `yarn dev` to launch the project.

The dependencies have not been upgraded, it is still in Vue.js 2.x and co.

This project is about the delivery of pills.
It was hosted in Azure but the resource group has been deleted since then.
Nor the server, the database, domain name... exist anymore.
